This notebook illustrates how to, for multi-animal projects, use the cloud-based GPU to:
- create a multi-animal training set
- train a network
- evaluate a network
- analyze novel videos
- assemble animals and tracklets
- create quality check plots!

###This notebook assumes you already have a DLC project folder with labeled data and you uploaded it to your own Google Drive.

This notebook demonstrates the necessary steps to use DeepLabCut for your own project.

This shows the most simple code to do so, but many of the functions have additional features, so please check out the docs on GitHub. We also recommend checking out our preprint, which covers the science of maDLC

**Lauer et al 2021:** https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.30.442096v1

## First, go to "Runtime" ->"change runtime type"->select "Python3", and then select "GPU"

- This code assumes you locally installed DeepLabCut, created a project, extracted and labeled frames. Be sure to "check Labels" to confirm you are happy with your data. As, these frames are the only thing that is used to train your network. ðŸ’ª You can find all the docs to do this here: https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut

#Whichever you chose, you will see what looks like an error message, but it's not an error - don't worry....

"""**When you hit "STOP" you will get a KeyInterrupt "error"! No worries! :)**

## Start evaluating: 

 - First, we evaluate the pose estimation performance.

- This function evaluates a trained model for a specific shuffle/shuffles at a particular state or all the states on the data set (images) and stores the results as .5 and .csv file in a subdirectory under **evaluation-results**

- If the scoremaps do not look accurate, don't proceed to tracklet assembly; please consider (1) adding more data, (2) adding more bodyparts!

- more info: https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/docs/maDLC_UserGuide.html#evaluate-the-trained-network

Here is an example of what you'd aim to see before proceeding:

"""IF these images, numbers, and maps do not look good, do not proceed. You should increase the diversity and number of frames you label, and re-create a training dataset and re-train!

## Start Analyzing videos: 
This function analyzes the new video. The user can choose the best model from the evaluation results and specify the correct snapshot index for the variable **snapshotindex** in the **config.yaml** file. Otherwise, by default the most recent snapshot is used to analyse the video.

The results are stored in a pickle file in the same directory where the video resides.
